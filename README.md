# Codestagram Photo Filters

Today we're making a photo sharing site called Codestagram. Users will be able
to upload photos, and get a page with their photos run through cool filters.

## How This Project Works

app.js is filled with comments that indicate what our app needs to do to be
completed. Some of those comments might reference this readme, so be sure to
keep it open. Follow the comments one by one, and make sure to run your project
frequently to make sure everything's going smoothly. Console log anything you're
unfamiliar with, so that you can see what it is.
